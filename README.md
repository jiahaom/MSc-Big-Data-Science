Hello, I'm Jiahao! I'm a Data Analyst/Engineer with experience in NLP, machine learning, and statistics. I currently work at Kortext, graduated from Queen Mary University of London, where I learnt and built recommendation systems and analytics tools. I'm proficient in Python and have experience with big data technologies such as PySpark. I'm also familiar with A/B testing and enjoy deploying and maintaining models. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
